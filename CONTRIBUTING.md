Esri welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/esri/contributing).

### Before filing an issue

If something isn't working the way you expected, please take a look at [previously logged issues](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-rest-js/issues) first.  Have you found a new bug?  Want to request a new feature?  We'd [love](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-rest-js/issues/new) to hear from you.

If you're looking for help you can also post issues on [GIS Stackexchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=esri-oss).

**Please include the following information in your issue:**
* Browser (or Node.js) version
* a snippet of code
* an explanation of
  * what you saw
  * what you expected to see

### I want to contribute, what should I work on?

Any open issues are fair game. Even just telling us what you want to see would be extremely helpful!

### Getting a development environment set up

You don't _have to_ but we recommend installing TypeScript, Prettier and EditorConfig extensions for your editor of choice.

* https://code.visualstudio.com/
* https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin
* etc...

### Running the tests

@esri/arcgis-rest-js has a comprehensive test suite built with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) The tests can be found in `/packages/*/test/`.

You can run _all_ the tests with `npm test`.

* `npm run test:chrome:debug` runs the Karma tests in Chrome and watches for changes. In the opened Chrome window you can click "Debug" and refresh the page to enter the debugger for tests.
* `npm run test:node:debug` run the node tests, automatically opening the Chrome (60+) debugger. This is great for debugging the tests while you are working.

### Formatting commit messsages
Using [`npm run c`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-rest-js/blob/fd9005fef74c33c684273fd283aa6bd9990e8630/package.json#L110) (instead of `git commit`) create messages our handy [script](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-rest-js/blob/master/support/changelog.js) can parse to categorize your bug fix, new feature or breaking change and associate it with relevant packages in our [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) automatically.

This isn't mandatory, but it is pretty cool. :sparkles:

### Documentation Site

We use TypeDoc to turn the inline documentation into the [API Reference section of the documentation website](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-rest-js/api-reference/). If you see any issue with any page on the API Reference, you can fix that by updating the inline documentation comments in this repository. If you have an issue with one of the samples or other guide pages, please [log a documentation issue](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-rest-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Documentation&template=documentation.yml).

### Watching local source for changes

you can run the command below in the root of the repo to automatically recompile a package when the raw TypeScript source changes

```
# watch 'request' and rebuild a UMD for the browser
npm run dev -- umd @esri/arcgis-rest-request

# rebuild ES6 files
npm run dev -- esm @esri/arcgis-rest-request

# rebuild CommonJS
npm run dev -- node @esri/arcgis-rest-request

# watch all the packages
npm run dev -- umd @esri/*
```
