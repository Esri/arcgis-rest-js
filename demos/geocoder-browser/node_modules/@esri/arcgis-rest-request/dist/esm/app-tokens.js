 * Request a token for a specific application using the esri_aopc encrypted cookie
 *
 * When a client app boots up, it will know its clientId and the redirectUri for use
 * in the normal /oauth/authorize pop-out oAuth flow.
 *
 * If the app sees an `esri_aopc` cookie (only set if the app is hosted on *.arcgis.com),
 * it can call the /oauth2/platformSelf end-point passing in the clientId and redirectUri
 * in headers, and it will receive back an app-specific token, assuming the user has
 * access to the app.
 *
 * Since there are scenarios where an app can boot using credentials/token from localstorage
 * but those credentials are not for the same user as the esri_aopc cookie, it is recommended that
 * an app check the returned username against any existing identity they may have loaded.
 *
 * Note: This is only usable by Esri applications hosted on *arcgis.com, *esri.com or within
 * an ArcGIS Enterprise installation. Custom applications can not use this.

 * // convert the encrypted platform cookie into a ArcGISIdentityManager
 * import { platformSelf, ArcGISIdentityManager } from '@esri/arcgis-rest-auth';
 *
 * const portal = 'https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest';
 * const clientId = 'YOURAPPCLIENTID';
 *
 * // exchange esri_aopc cookie
 * return platformSelf(clientId, 'https://your-app-redirect-uri', portal)

 *  const currentTimestamp = new Date().getTime();
