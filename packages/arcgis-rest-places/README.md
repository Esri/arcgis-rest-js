### Contributing

Esri welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Generating Types from Open API

The places service publishes an Open API definition. Eventually this will live at a public URL on the service itself. However for now it lives inside the Esri internal GitHub Enterprise installation. To generate the types view the raw file on GitHub Enterprise and replace the URL below.

```
npx openapi-typescript@5 URL_TO_RAW_SPEC_FILE --output packages/arcgis-rest-places/src/openapi-types.ts
```

The generated types are used in the interfaces for ArcGIS REST JS.
