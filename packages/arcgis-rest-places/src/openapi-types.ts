    /**
     * A category describes a type of place, such as "movie theater" or "zoo".
     * The places service has over 1,000 categories (or types) of place. The
     * categories fall into ten general groups: Arts and Entertainment, Business
     * and Professional Services, Community and Government, Dining and Drinking,
     * Events, Health and Medicine, Landmarks and Outdoors, Retail, Sports and
     * Recreation, and Travel and Transportation.
     *
     * The categories are organized into a hierarchical system where a general
     * category contains many more detailed variations on the parent category.
     * For example: "Travel and Transportation" (Level 1),
     * "Transport Hub" (Level 2), "Airport" (Level  3) and "Airport Terminal"
     * (Level 4). The hierarchy has up to 5 levels of categories.
     *
     * The table below shows the top-level of categories, along with a
     * selection of level two categories.
     *
     * The `/categories` endpoint fetches the latest set of place categories.
     * The request returns all categories including their label and
     * `categoryId`. You should use this endpoint to fetch the latest set of
     * categories when your app starts up. Each category contains an unique ID
     * that you can use to perform a `near-point` or `within-extent` search.
     *
     * You can also reduce the list to a subset of categories using the
     * `filter` parameter. For example, searching for "coffee" would return
     * categories including:
     *
     * - "Coffee Shop"
     *
     * - "Coffee Roaster"
     *
     * - "Turkish Coffeehouse"

   * and Professional Services, Community and Government, Dining and Drinking,
   * Events, Health and Medicine, Landmarks and Outdoors, Retail, Sports and
   * Recreation, and Travel and Transportation.
   *
   * The categories are organized into a hierarchical system where a general

   * For example: "Travel and Transportation" (Level 1),
   * "Transport Hub" (Level 2), "Airport" (Level  3) and "Airport Terminal"
   * (Level 4). The hierarchy has up to 5 levels of categories.
   *
   * The table below shows the top-level of categories, along with a
   * selection of level two categories.
   *
   * The `/categories` endpoint fetches the latest set of place categories.
   * The request returns all categories including their label and

   * categories when your app starts up. Each category contains an unique ID
   * that you can use to perform a `near-point` or `within-extent` search.
   *
   * You can also reduce the list to a subset of categories using the
   * `filter` parameter. For example, searching for "coffee" would return

   * It is always recommended to specify the fields you want, however, you

   * to the other attributes you requested.
   *

   * You will only be charged for attributes that contain valid values for
   * the requested fields. If no data is available for the requested field,
