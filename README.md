### Example

```js
import { request } from "@esri/arcgis-rest-request";

const url =
  "https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/6e03e8c26aad4b9c92a87c1063ddb0e3/data";

request(url).then((response) => {
  console.log(response); // WebMap JSON
});
```

### Get Started

To get started, go to [ArcGIS REST JS on the ArcGIS Developers website](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-rest-js/).

### Documentation

The documentation is published at https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-rest-js/ and is maintained in a private repository and managed by the ArcGIS Developer Experience team. The [API reference](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-rest-js/api-reference/) is generated automatically by [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) via the `npm run typedoc` command and the [`typedoc.json` configuration file](./typedoc.json).

### Instructions

You can install dependencies by cloning the repository and running:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

This will install all dependencies and do an initial build. Afterward, you can run any of the [demo apps](./demos/) by `cd`'ing by following the README for the specific demo. For a list of all available commands run `npm run`.

For all packages:

- `npm run build` - builds all distributions of every package with `ultra`, inside each package builds are done in parallel with `npm-run-all`. Output is errors only.
- `npm run build:esm`, `npm run build:cjs`, `npm run build:bundled` - as as the above but only one of our target distributions.
- `npm run dev:esm`, `npm run dev:cjs`, `npm run dev:bundled` - runs the appropriate watch command in all packages.

For a specific package:

- `npm run build -w @esri/arcgis-rest-request` - run all builds in a specific workspace
- `npm run dev -w @esri/arcgis-rest-request` - run all dev commands in a specific workspace
- `npm run build:esm -w @esri/arcgis-rest-request` - run the esm build in a specific workspace
- `npm run dev:esm -w @esri/arcgis-rest-request` - run the esm dev command in a specific workspace
- `npm run build:cjs -w @esri/arcgis-rest-request` - run the common js build in a specific workspace
- `npm run dev:cjs -w @esri/arcgis-rest-request` - run the common js dev command in a specific workspace
- `npm run build:bundled -w @esri/arcgis-rest-request` - run the rollup build in a specific workspace
- `npm run dev:bundled -w @esri/arcgis-rest-request` - run the rollup dev command in a specific workspace
