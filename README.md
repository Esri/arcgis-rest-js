### API Reference

The documentation is published at http://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/ (source code [here](/docs/src)).

### Instructions

You can install dependencies (and bootstrap lerna) by cloning the repository and running:

```bash
npm install
```

Afterward, for a list of all available commands run `npm run`.

Some useful commands include:

* `npm test` runs _all_ the tests and confirms the API is functioning as expected.
* There is also a `Debug Node Tests` configuration in the `.vscode/launch.json` which will run the Node tests in the VS Code debugger.
* `npm run docs:serve` will run the documentation site locally at http://localhost:3000
* `npm run build` will created UMD bundles for _all_ the packages
* `npm run dev -- <esm|node|umd> <glob>` will re-run the specified build type anytime the source code changes. Example: `npm run dev -- umd @esri/*`
